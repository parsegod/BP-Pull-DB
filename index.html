          <h3>Exploit Explanation</h3>
              <p>This method utilizes the way the game organizes weapon blueprints within its files, specifically in designated 𝗽𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀. The method of adding weapon blueprints to the game also involves these pools. What this means is that if you possess any blueprint from a corresponding pool, you can use it to pull another blueprint from that very same pool. We have undertaken the extensive process of entering the game, gathering, and sorting all of these pools based on this blueprint pulling mechanism. Our objective is to meticulously document all blueprints and their corresponding pools. This effort aims to assist the community in efficiently pulling the specific blueprint they are looking for.</p>
              <p>If you're still unsure how our system works, let's walk through an example. We'll use the 𝗖𝟵 "𝗧𝗛𝗘 𝗣𝗔𝗜𝗡𝗧𝗦𝗧𝗢𝗥𝗠" variant, which is stored in 𝗣𝗼𝗼𝗹 𝟭𝟱. Assuming you're familiar with the pulling exploit,here's how it would work: You'd transfer the C9 to your alternate account. Then, on your main account, you'd pick any blueprint that's also stored in 𝗣𝗼𝗼𝗹 𝟭𝟱 (i.e 𝗧𝗔𝗧𝗢 .𝟮𝟮 "𝗙𝗜𝗦𝗦𝗜𝗢𝗡") and perform the pull exploit. You should then successfully pull the 𝗖𝟵 "𝗧𝗛𝗘 𝗣𝗔𝗜𝗡𝗧𝗦𝗧𝗢𝗥𝗠".</p>

          <h3>Zombies Exploit </h3>
              <p>If you’re still unsure about how this exploit works or how to perform the pulling process, don’t worry — it will become clearer as you follow along.</p>
              <p>First, it’s important to know that this exploit only works on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, last-gen consoles and PC players do not have access to split-screen, so this won’t work for you. Also, Player 2 doesn’t need a leveled-up account, but having one makes the pulls easier. If Player 2 uses a fresh account, you may need to perform an extra glitch to equip locked weapons in your Zombies loadout.</p>
              <p>Now, here’s how it works: start by launching Call of Duty and go into Zombies mode. Connect a second controller and sign in with your secondary profile. Set up Player 2’s loadout with the weapon you want to pull prints for (like the LADRA). 
              Then back out to the screen where you can edit your main loadouts—that will affect Controller 1’s loadouts. On your main account, equip the blueprint you want to use to pull the print. After that, back out to the main menu where you can select Multiplayer, Zombies, or Campaign. 
              With Controller 2, select Zombies mode. Finally, go back to Player 1’s main loadout, and you should see the print you were trying to pull, as long as you’ve followed everything correctly.</p>

          <h3>Multiplayer Exploit </h3>   
<p>Okay, so similar to the zombies pulling exploit, you can pull weapons via the same pools if you do the some simple steps. Now the way this specific multiplayer exploit works you are going to only need one player (meaning you can do this on pc and last gen consoles) with that being said there are a few things you want to keep in mind before doing this. The first thing is you’re going to need a unowned camo now if you don’t know what this is, basically it’s just a gun that you have a camo on that’s not unlocked yet the other thing to be aware of is build limits, if you are at your build limit or nearing it then it will be very difficult if not impossible for this certain exploit to work for you. Lastly, be aware that if you wanna add attachments and camo’s, you have to add camos and then add attachments and the process of adding camos requires you to repull the print. With that being said let’s get into it.</p>

<p>Okay, so similar to zombies you are going to want to put the blueprint you want to pull with in your priv/pub (depending what mode you are pulling in) multiplayer class #1 and also make sure to delete all the attachments (as having attachments will make the pull completely random) now just go and start up a game now from here you are going to edit the class and equip the unowned camo gun into your #1 class now you are gonna want to kill yourself or have someone kill you and then you are gonna go to that #1 class and create a new build for the gun you want to pull. Now simply kill yourself or have someone kill you once more and boom you should have that pulled print. Simply equip the unowned camo gun one more time and boom it should be saved.</p>

<p>Now you will notice that the print you pulled doesn’t have any attachments now can fix this and either add custom attachments or we can just rest the print to default.</p>

<p>So first we’re gonna go through how you can go about doing this. Okay so now that you have the desired print in your #1 class you are gonna wanna head into another game now from here once you load in you are just gonna wanna edit the class and add the attachments you want and then simply kill yourself or have someone kill you and then equip the unowned camo again. Now from here you can kill yourself again if you want to, but it’s not needed you can just back out. Now you’ll see the attachments have been added to your gun. Now, if you want to reset your default (how the base print looks), it’s very simply just go into the builds and rest the build to default.</p>

<p>Now say you wanna add your owned camos to this print since you can’t just add camos directly in the loadout menu as this will rest this class to default you are going to be doing another glitch. So what you wanna do is head over to the gun that you pulled and create a new build for that gun simply add the camo charm and or decals that you want on the gun and simply just create a build(we like to call it “camo” just to make it easy) now simply just go into a game (make sure that you have the print you used to pull the desired print with no attachments again as for adding camos you need to repull or add them in the beginning when you first pull. So you go through the pulling process and then after you create the new build you are going to want to just simply equip the “camo” build and then kill and then boom you should have that camo decals and or charm. Simply just equip the unowned camo gun to save it and back out and it should have saved no after this you can go do the attachments exploit in order to have attachments and camos.</p>
