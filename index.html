  <strong>Explanation:</strong> This tool utilizes the way the game organizes weapon blueprints within its files, specifically in designated 𝗽𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀. The method of adding weapon blueprints to the game also involves these pools. What this means is that if you possess any blueprint from a corresponding pool, you can use it to pull another blueprint from that very same pool. We have undertaken the extensive process of entering the game, gathering, and sorting all of these pools based on this blueprint pulling mechanism. Our objective is to meticulously document all blueprints and their corresponding pools. This effort aims to assist the community in efficiently pulling the specific blueprint they are looking for.

          <li>
  <strong>Example: </strong>If you're still unsure how our system works, let's walk through an example. We'll use the 𝗖𝟵 "𝗧𝗛𝗘 𝗣𝗔𝗜𝗡𝗧𝗦𝗧𝗢𝗥𝗠" variant, which is stored in 𝗣𝗼𝗼𝗹 𝟭𝟱. Assuming you're familiar with the 2-player exploit pulling method (note: other pulling methods, like the attachment method, don't necessarily follow the same storage patterns in pools, we're still researching how and if they might stored), here's how it would work: You'd transfer the C9 to your alternate account. Then, on your main account, you'd pick any blueprint that's also stored in 𝗣𝗼𝗼𝗹 𝟭𝟱 (i.e 𝗧𝗔𝗡𝗧𝗢 .𝟮𝟮 "𝗙𝗜𝗦𝗦𝗜𝗢𝗡") and perform the pull method. You should then successfully pull the 𝗖𝟵 "𝗧𝗛𝗘 𝗣𝗔𝗜𝗡𝗧𝗦𝗧𝗢𝗥𝗠". 
</li>

  <strong>Exploit Method:</strong> If you’re still unsure about how this method works or how to perform the pulling process, don’t worry — it will become clearer as you follow along.

  First, it’s important to know that this method only works on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, last-gen consoles and PC players do not have access to split-screen, so this won’t work for you. Also, Player 2 doesn’t need a leveled-up account, but having one makes the pulls easier. If Player 2 uses a fresh account, you may need to perform an extra glitch to equip locked weapons in your Zombies loadout. 

  Now, here’s how it works: start by launching Call of Duty and go into Zombies mode. Connect a second controller and sign in with your secondary profile. Set up Player 2’s loadout with the weapon you want to pull prints for (like the LADRA). 

  Then back out to the screen where you can edit your main loadouts—that will affect Controller 1’s loadouts. On your main account, equip the blueprint you want to use to pull the print. After that, back out to the main menu where you can select Multiplayer, Zombies, or Campaign. 

  With Controller 2, select Zombies mode. Finally, go back to Player 1’s main loadout, and you should see the print you were trying to pull, as long as you’ve followed everything correctly.
